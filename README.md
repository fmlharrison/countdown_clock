#Countdown Clock

This is a small programme I wrote that ask the user to input a certain time and
it then starts counting down to that time.
I wrote this to practice making a single page web app and to practice Javascript
and jQuery.

##Developer Acknowledgment
The animation for the clock face was taken from CodePen and was developed by Simon
Patrat. You can see some more of his work at simonpatrat.com.
